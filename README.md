## General Definition Of Digital Watermarking

A watermark is a logo that stands for watermark and prevents copying when placed on an image or image. Sometimes it can be used not as a logo, but as a special text. When using Watermark, you can block the copy or see the original author even if there is a copy. Sometimes the site logo and sometimes different names are placed on the image or in a blocking corner to create this purpose.

The picture above is an example of a watermark. He embedded the logo (watermark) into the picture, making it less obvious. Thus, stealing the logo has become more difficult.


Watermark is a feature that is generally valid for transactions on the internet. Therefore, if you want to watermark any image you want to protect, you can easily do this from your computer. Watermark can be created very easily with any photo editing program. One of these programs is the "Watermark" application that we have implemented.

<a name="History"></a>
## History Of Watermarking

The term "Digital Watermark" was coined in 1992 by Andrew Tirkel and Charles Osborne. 

Watermarks are identification marks produced during the papermaking process. The first watermarks appeared in Italy in the 13th century, but their use quickly spread throughout Europe. Watermarks continue to be used today as manufacturer marks and to prevent counterfeiting.

## Watermark Types

* **Text:** The manuscripts must be protected and not stolen. Therefore, it is one of the watermark types. In the picture below, the watermark technique is used to prevent the text from being stolen. The image below is an example of a watermark made for the Text.


* **Image:** Images can be made more secure by using watermark techniques so that they are not copied or stolen. Some watermark techniques have been applied to the pictures in the image below and the pictures have been made reliable.


* **Audio:** Copying sounds can cause many problems nowadays. Therefore, watermark techniques are used to prevent the sounds from being copied. The following example shows how the watermark technique is applied to a sound.


* **Video:** Copying videos can cause many problems nowadays. Therefore, watermark techniques are used to prevent the videos from being copied.

## Classification Watermarking Techniques

There are some techniques applied to make watermarks. These techniques are schematized as follows.

### Based on Human Perceptron


<a name="Visible"></a>
- **Visible** 

A watermark logo can be viewed as the property of the ownership. In the example shown below, the logo is visible. However, its opacity has been lowered. 

<p align="center">

</p>


<a name="invisible"></a>
- **Invisible**

These watermarks are embedded in the media and use steganography technique. They are not visible by naked eyes. Distortion of embedded is too small to be noticed. A watermark can be extracted by authorized extraction software. The image below is an example made using invisible watermark techniques.

</p>


<a name="fragile"></a>
- **Fragile**

In the Fragile Watermarks, watermark fails to be detected from the watermarked image after slight modification. These watermarks are destroyed by data manipulation. There must be a system which can detect all changes in the data if fragile watermarks are to be used.

</p>


<a name="robust"></a>
- **Robust**


In the Robust watermark, the watermark resists different types of attack. Robust watermarks may be used in copy protection applications to carry copy and no access control information. In the example below, a watermark was made using the Robust feature.
